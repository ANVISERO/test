<p>The number of job openings has trended downward since mid-2007, and, at 2.7 million in March, the number of monthly job openings was down 2.1 million (or 44 percent) since the most recent high point in June 2007. </p>
<p>The decline in job openings was due to a significant decline in retail trade, and small declines in nearly every other industry. </p>
