<p>In 2008, the U.S. median wage was $15.57 per hour or $32,390 per year, 
  according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) of the U.S. Department 
  of Labor.  These data are from the Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) 
  program, which provides employment and wage estimates for wage and salary 
  workers in 22 major occupational groups and 801 detailed occupations.  </p>
<p>OES 
    produces data by occupation for the nation, states, metropolitan areas, 
    metropolitan divisions, and nonmetropolitan areas, and by occupation and 
    industry for the nation.</p>
<p>The median wage represents the pay of the typical worker.  Many of the 
  occupations with wages within this range were office and administrative
support, construction and extraction, or production occupations. </p>

<p>The Occupational Employment Statistics program produces cross-industry occupational employment and wage estimates nationwide and
  for all states, 377 metropolitan areas, 34 metropolitan divisions,
  and 174 nonmetropolitan areas.  OES also publishes national industry-specific occupational employment and wage estimates for NAICS sectors
  and 3-, 4-, and selected 5-digit industries.  In addition to mean
  hourly and annual wages, wage data include 10th, 25th, 50th (median),
  75th, and 90th percentile wages, which can be used to show the distri-
  bution of wages within an occupation or industry.  OES data are pro-
  duced by a cooperative effort between BLS and State Workforce Agencies, 
  and are based on a sample of 1.2 million business establishments, col-
  lected in 6 semiannual panels over a 3-year period.  Complete May 2008 
  Occupational Employment Statistics data are available from the OES Web 
  site at http://www.bls.gov/oes/.</p>
