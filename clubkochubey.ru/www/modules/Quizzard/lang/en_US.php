$lang['help'] = '<h3>What Does This Do?</h3>
<p>Quiz Module</p>
<h3>How Do I Use It</h3>
<p>Go into the admin. Create a quiz. Place a quiz tag in some content page. Done! (more specific information follows)</p>
<h4>Quizzes Tab</h4>
<p>This lists the quizzes defined in your install. It gives you the ability to add new ones, view the results of quizzes,
export quizzes, validate all the answers on a single page, delete quizzes, etc.</p>
<p>To put an extant quiz in a page, simply copy the tag that looks like &#123;cms_module module="Quizzard" quiz_id="x"&#125;
where quiz_id is taken from the table, and place it in your page.
<h4>Question Types</h4>
<p>When creating a quiz, there are three types of questions, and three types of "control" questions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Multiple Choice. This is a question followed by a collection of possible answers. Only one answer can be selected, and only on answer can be correct.</li>
<li>Choose One or More. Awkwardly named, but this is a question followed by a collection of possible answers. Multiple answers may be selected and multiple answers can be correct -- to get scored as "correct," the quiz taker must select all correct answers.</li>
<li>Fill in the Blank(s). This is a sentence where one or more words are missing, and the user must type in the correct word(s).</li>
<li>* Quiz Section. This splits a quiz. You can choose to number questions relative to their sections if you want to structure a big quiz.</li>
<li>* Line of Text. This is explanatory text that shows in the quiz.</li>
<li>- Page Break. This splits a quiz into multiple pages.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Import Tab</h4>
<p>You can import quiz XML files here. To get a Quiz XML file, you have to have exported a quiz from the main Quiz tab.</p>
<h4>Extra Field Tab</h4>
<p>On the initial sign-up page for the quiz, many people wanted fields in addition to name and email. This page allows you to add field. There are four types: text field, checkbox, numeric, and US Phone number. Each has a variant which requires a response. You can set the display size and maximum size (which only actually works on fields for which it makes sense), and a weight, which determines the display order.</p>
<p>These extra fields will show up in the results that get displayed to the admin and/or in the quiz results email that gets sent.</p>
<h4>Score Threshold Tab</h4>
<p>Some specialized applications require that users score a certain percentage. You may set a minimum score for submission. This means that if a user has a score less than the threshold, they will be presented with the questions that they skipped or that are incorrect, and they need to correct these questions until their score is greater than the threshold.</p>
<p>You can show them all their incorrect answers on a single page, stripped of their context, or you can have them go through the quiz again, with their errors indicated.</p>
<h4>Quiz Template Tab</h4>
<p>By default, the Quiz is presented using a standard template that formats questions. You could style it simply by altering the CSS it uses, or you can go wild and edit the smarty template that generates the quiz itself. Use the existing template as an example. The smarty variables will be documented fully at some point. Similarly, the quiz "registration" page template is on this tab.</p>
<h4>Email Template Tab</h4>
<p>Quiz results are sent via email. You can edit the template here.</p>
<h4>Score Page Template Tab</h4>
<p>Similar to the Email Template, this page shows the user their quiz results. You can do all sorts of creative stuff here. This template is actually internally documented.</p>
<h4>Email Config Tab</h4>
<p>This lets you customize the email header details for results emails. You can also opt here to have the quiz administrator receive a copy of every quiz taken, and the results.</p>
<h4>Character Tool Tab</h4>
<p>Semi-experimental, this is for enabling quiz takers who are language-challenged or have language-challenged keyboards (e.g., U.S. Americans) enter "foreign" characters. When active, it pops up a floating palette that allows the quiz taker to insert characters like &uuml; or &egrave; at the active cursor point in a field. It also enables Quiz Admins to do the same when creating quizzes. It does not work with WYSIWYG editors.</p>
<h4>Configuration Tab</h4>
<p>This is where you get to choose a lot of specifics about how your quiz will work.</p>

<p>Quizzard is still inadequately documented. This will be fixed eventually.</p>
